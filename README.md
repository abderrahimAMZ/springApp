One On One Chat application | Spring boot & WebSocket | By Alibou

## Overview

Explore the world of **WebSockets** with **Alibou**, your experienced software engineer guide. If you missed our previous session delving into the magic of WebSockets and creating a lively group chat application, catch up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T-HnTE6v64&ab_channel=BoualiAli).

Today's focus is on real-time communication, as we build a **one-on-one chat application** that ensures private, secure conversations. Taking it a step further, we'll persist these chats in a **MongoDB database**.
